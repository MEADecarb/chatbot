### Important Information
This application is designed with your privacy and data security in mind. Here's how it works:

1. **Session State Reset:** At the start of each session, the application resets its internal session state. This means that any data from previous sessions is cleared, ensuring that no information carries over from one use to the next.

2. **Temporary Data Storage:** When you use this chatbot, the website content and your conversation history are only stored temporarily within the current session. As soon as you close the app or start a new session, this data is automatically deleted.

3. **No Permanent Storage:** The app does not store any of the fetched website content or your conversations permanently. Once you end your session, all data is removed from the app's memory.

4. **Security:** This process helps ensure that your interaction remains private and is not accessible after you finish using the app.

In summary, every time you use the app, it starts with a clean slate, clearing all previous session data to protect your privacy and maintain data security.

### How This Chatbot Works
- This chatbot provides information solely based on the content of the Maryland Energy Administration website.
- All responses are generated using only the information from the website pages.
- If the chatbot doesn't have information to answer a question, it will clearly state that.
- Each response includes a confidence score and a source URL for transparency.
- If you believe a response is inaccurate, please use the report button below the response.
