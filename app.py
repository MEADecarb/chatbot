### How This Chatbot Works
- This chatbot provides information based on the content of the Maryland Energy Administration website.
- It can summarize information from multiple pages and make connections between different topics.
- The chatbot will provide source URLs when possible to allow you to read more on the MEA website.
- If the chatbot is unsure about specific details, it will say so but try to provide related information.
- The goal is to be informative and helpful while maintaining accuracy about MEA programs and initiatives.
