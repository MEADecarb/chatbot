st.markdown("""
### How This Chatbot Works
- This chatbot provides information primarily based on the content of the Maryland Energy Administration website.
- It can also use general knowledge to provide context or explanations when appropriate.
- The chatbot will prioritize information from the MEA website but may make reasonable inferences or provide additional context.
- If the chatbot is unsure about MEA-specific information, it will clearly state that.
- The goal is to be informative and helpful while maintaining a high degree of accuracy.
